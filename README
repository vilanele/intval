Abstract : 

The construction by M.Bhargava of a generalised factorial function in any Dedekind domain D lead to
an elegant caracterisation of integer-valued polynomials in D[X], as well as other submodules of such
polynomials verifying more constraints. The construction is naturally algorithmic, and I provide
in this thesis algorithms in the case where D is the ring of integers of a number field, extending 
existing ones over Z.

I provide also an implementation in C using the library Pari/GP of those algorithms, as well as 
other related functions in the library named 'libfact' that you can find at

                              https://github.com/vilanele/libfact
                              
This library provide more than 60 functions directly usable in a gp-session, or in C code eventually.
See the library documentation for more details. Some examples are given in the thesis.
